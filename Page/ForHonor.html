                    For Honor is a hack and slash fighting game developed and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and
                    Xbox One. The game allows players to play the roles of historical forms of soldiers and warriors, including
                    knights, samurai, and vikings within a medieval setting, controlled using a third-person perspective
                    Announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015, the game was developed primarily by Ubisoft's studio
                    in Montreal, and released worldwide on February 14, 2017. Reception of the game was generally positive,
                    with criticism mostly directed at the multiplayer matchmaking and the many technical issues regarding
                    it. The game has also been criticized for excessive microtransactions.

                        Gameplay
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        For Honor is an action fighting game set during a medieval period inspired fantasy setting. Players can play as a character
                        from three different factions, namely The Iron Legion Knights, The Chosen Samurai, and The Warborn
                        Vikings. The three factions represent knights, samurai, and vikings, respectively. Each faction had
                        four classes at launch, with two more being added at the beginning of every season of the Faction
                        War. The Vanguard class is described as "well-balanced" and has excellent offense and defense. The
                        Assassin class is fast and efficient in dueling enemies, but the class deals much less damage to
                        enemies. The Heavies are more resistant to damages and are suitable for holding capture points, though
                        their attacks are slow. The last class, known as "Hybrids", are a combination of two of the three
                        types, and is capable of using uncommon skills. All heroes are unique and have their own weapons,
                        skills, and fighting styles. There are 12 pieces of downloadable content. Players fight against their
                        opponents with their class-specific melee weapons. When players perform certain actions, such as
                        killing multiple enemies consecutively, they gain Feats, which are additional perks. These perks
                        allow players to gain additional points and strengths, call in a barrage of arrows or a catapult
                        attack, or heal themselves. In most missions, players are accompanied by numerous AI minions. They
                        are significantly weaker than the player character, and do not pose much threat. A tactical combat
                        system, known as "Art of Battle", is initiated when the player encounters other players or player-like
                        AI in the multiplayer or higher health AI in the campaign. Players enter a dueling mode with them
                        wherein players aim at their opponent with their weapon. Players then can choose how to place and
                        position their weapons from three directions (from above, the right, and the left) when they are
                        attacking their enemies. By observing on-screen hints and the movements of their opponents, which
                        reflect their respective attack position, players can notice the weakest part of their enemies and
                        attacks these parts. Choosing the correct position can block the other players' attack. Players also
                        have other special abilities, such as barging into enemies with their own shoulders and performing
                        back-stepping swipes. The strength of each attack can also be decided by players. The system aims
                        at allowing players to "feel the weight of the weapon in [their] hand".

                        Story
                    </h3>
                    The warlord Apollyon takes control of the knights of the Blackstone Legion after murdering her rivals, who fight for the
                    people of the land of Ashfeld, allowing her to sow the seeds of perpetual war and create stronger men
                    to rule over the weak. During the Blackstone Legion's attempt to bring a dishonorable lord-turned-mercenary,
                    Hervis Daubeny, to justice, his second-in-command, known as the Warden, helps to stop the Blackstone
                    siege and battles the champion of the Blackstone knights. Upon defeating a Blackstone Legion captain,
                    Ademar, the Warden is made a knight of the Legion by Holden Cross, Apollyon's lieutenant, and leaves
                    with him. During his time in Apollyon's army, the Warden helps to defend against the Viking raiders of
                    the Warborn, but soon realizes shortly after meeting with Apollyon that she cares nothing about protecting
                    people and seeks to manipulate her enemies into endless battles. Starting with the Vikings, Apollyon
                    and her warriors including Cross, the Warden and fellow lieutenants Stone and Mercy, attack their settlements
                    and sack their strongholds in the northern land of Valkenheim, leaving only enough food and supplies
                    to fight over, and sparing those who would eagerly fight for those scraps or are strong enough to do
                    so. After killing the legendary Viking Jarl, Gudmundr, the Warden is sickened by this, leading him to
                    desert the Blackstone Legion, soon followed by Holden. Afterwards, in Valkenheim, the Viking clans fight
                    among themselves, killing one another for the dwindling scraps left by Apollyon. This continues until
                    a powerful warrior known as the Raider comes down from the mountains, and begins uniting the warriors
                    of the various clans under the Warborn banner, alongside warlord friend Stigandr, valkyrie warrior Runa
                    and berserker Helvar, first by killing the brutal raider Ragnar, who steals what little remains from
                    those who cannot feed themselves, and then Siv the Ruthless, who seeks to conquer and plunder their own
                    people. After killing their rivals, the Raider's rapidly growing army retake a Warborn stronghold from
                    knights of Apollyon's army, and then set out to the land of the Myre to raid the Dawn Empire of the Chosen,
                    a group of powerful Samurai, to resupply and feed their people. The Raider then leads the assault on
                    the Samurai, kills the Samurai General, Tozen, and causes the Samurai to retreat back to their greatest
                    city. In the chaos, Apollyon kills the Dawn Empire's ruler and his Daimyos that refuse to fight each
                    other and setting free the ones she believes will kill one another and in turn become stronger. Into
                    this chaos is brought the Orochi warrior known as the Emperor's champion, the strongest and most fearsome
                    warrior in the Dawn Empire. The champion was imprisoned for speaking out of turn and was freed during
                    the chaos of the Viking raid. The Orochi helps to push back the Vikings, but fails to prevent Apollyon
                    from riding through the chaos and murdering the Imperial family, forcing the Daimyos to fight one another
                    for control of the Dawn Empire. After learning of the devastation the Viking raid caused, she/he, fellow
                    samurai Ayu, the Shugoki Okuma and Nobushi Momiji attempt to reunite the Daimyos under one banner, using
                    the vikings as a common enemy to rally against. The Emperor's Champion infiltrates the Emperor's palace
                    with Momiji and confronts Seijuro, the Daimyo who took Apollyon's offer to become Emperor. After defeating
                    Seijuro, the champion convinces him to join him against Apollyon. It is also during this time that the
                    Emperor's Champion learns of Apollyon's manipulations of the various factions and rallies allies to stop
                    Apollyon, invading Ashfeld to attack Blackstone Fortress. During a scouting mission with Momiji, the
                    Orochi is met by the Warden, now leading a rebellion against Apollyon with Holden, Stone and Mercy by
                    his side and, after dueling him, realizes they are allied against the same enemy. Both armies besiege
                    the castle on separate fronts, with the Orochi searching for Apollyon. After finding Apollyon, the Orochi
                    duels with and kills her, but not before learning that she wanted to create eternal war to weed out the
                    weak and create the strongest of men, making them evermore bloodthirsty. Despite her death, Apollyon
                    got what she wanted: an age of wolves. In the aftermath, the armies of all three factions attacking the
                    Blackstone Fortress; Knight, Samurai and Viking alike all turn on each other, resulting in a war lasting
                    seven years. Realizing the war's futility, Ayu, Cross, and Stigandr meet after their respective leaders
                    send them as envoys to end hostilities. Though all three people realize that the prospect of peace may
                    be futile, they all agree that peace is worth fighting for and that it will make for an unforgettable
                    tale.
